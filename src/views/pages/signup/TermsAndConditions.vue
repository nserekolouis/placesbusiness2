            or any features within the Services to you or to users generally. We also retain the

            applicable terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so
            in a separate agreement with Places (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if

            virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting
            the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue
            burden on the Services. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and

            except in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
            Places may offer certain services or features for which additional terms and
            conditions may apply in connection with your use of those services. By using
            or paying for any of these additional services, you agree to any additional terms
            applicable to those services, and those additional terms become part of our
            agreement with you. If any of the applicable additional terms conflict with these
            Terms, the additional terms will prevail while you are using those services to
            which they apply.
            If you use paid features of the Services, you agree to the applicable Terms for Paid
            Services <link>,

            Your Account
            You may need to create an account to use some of our Services. You are responsible
            for safeguarding your account, so use a strong password and limit its use to this
            account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your
            failure to comply with the above.
            You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to
            provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements
            and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of
            the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving
            them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or
            deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information to help
            prevent us from communicating with anyone who acquires your old number.
            Your License to Use the Services
            Places gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and nonexclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services.
            This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit
            of the Services as provided by Places, in the manner permitted by these Terms.
            The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the
            Uganda and other countries. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use
            the Places name or any of the Places trademarks, logos, domain names, other
            distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights. All right, title, and interest
            in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain
            the exclusive property of Places and its licensors. Any feedback, comments, or
            suggestions you may provide regarding Places, or the Services is entirely voluntary
            and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit
            and without any obligation to you.
            Ending These Terms
            You may end your legal agreement with Places at any time by deactivating your
            accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services. See <link> for instructions on how
            to deactivate your account and the Privacy Policy for more information on what
            happens to your information.
            We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or
            part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to,
            if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Places Rules and
            Policies or Periscope Community Guidelines, (ii) you create risk or possible legal
            exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct,
            (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision
            of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable
            efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next
            time you attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. In all
            such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license
            to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply:
            2, 3, 5, and 6. If you believe your account was terminated in error you can file an
            appeal following the steps found in our Help Center <link>. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms survive the
            deactivation or termination of your account.

            5. Disclaimers and
            Limitations of Liability
            The Services are Available “AS-IS”
            Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You
            understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and
            “AS AVAILABLE” basis. The “Places Entities” refers to Places, its parents, affiliates,
            related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners,
            and licensors. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted
            under applicable law, THE Places ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND
            CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
            FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. The Places Entities
            make no warranty or representation and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i)
            the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the
            Services or any Content; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or
            other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or any Content;
            (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any Content and other
            communications maintained by the Services; and (iv) whether the Services will meet
            your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis.
            No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Places Entities
            or through the Services, will create any warranty or representation not expressly
            made herein.
            Limitation of Liability
            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE Places
            ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
            CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR
            REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS
            OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i)
            YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES;
            (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES,
            INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL
            CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED
            FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF
            YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE
            LIABILITY OF THE Places ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED
            U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID Places, IF ANY, IN
            THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE
            LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,
            WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING
            NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE Places ENTITIES
            HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN
            IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL
            PURPOSE.

            6. General
            We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive,
            and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be at Places.com/tos,
            will govern our relationship with you. We will try to notify you of material revisions,
            for example via a service notification or an email to the email associated with your
            account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become
            effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
            The laws of the State of California, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern
            these Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Places. All disputes
            related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state
            courts located in San Francisco County, California, United States, and you consent
            to personal jurisdiction and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.
            If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using
            the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling
            law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you.
            For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related
            thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without
            reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent
            permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice
            of law).
            In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
            then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary,
            and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
            Places’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed
            a waiver of such right or provision.
            These Terms are an agreement between you and Places, Inc., 1355 Market Street,
            Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103 U.S.A. If you have any questions about these
            Terms, please contact us.
            Effective: June 10, 2022 
            If you live in the European Union, EFTA
            States, or the United Kingdom
            These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our services,

            graphics, photos, audio, videos, or other materials or arrangements of materials
            uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred to as

            Your Rights and Grant of Rights in the
            Content
            You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the
            Services. What’s yours is yours — you own your Content (and your incorporated
            audio, photos and videos are considered part of the Content).
            By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant
            us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to
            use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and
            distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods now known or
            later developed (for clarity, these rights include, for example, curating, transforming,
            and translating). This license authorizes us to make your Content available to the
            rest of the world and to let others do the same. You agree that this license includes
            the right for Places to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make
            Content submitted to or through the Services available to other companies,
            organizations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, Repost,
            promotion or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to
            our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by Places, or
            other companies, organizations or individuals, is made with no compensation paid to
            you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make
            available through the Services as the use of the Services by you is hereby agreed as
            being sufficient compensation for the Content and grant of rights herein.
            Places has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with
            your Content on the Services. These rules exist to enable an open ecosystem with
            your rights in mind. You understand that we may modify or adapt your Content as it
            is distributed, syndicated, published, or broadcast by us and our partners and/or
            make changes to your Content in order to adapt the Content to different media.
            You represent and warrant that you have, or have obtained, all rights, licenses,
            consents, permissions, power and/or authority necessary to grant the rights granted
            herein for any Content that you submit, post or display on or through the Services.
            You agree that such Content will not contain material subject to copyright or other
            proprietary rights, unless you have necessary permission or are otherwise legally
            entitled to post the material and to grant Places the license described above.
            4. Using the Services
            Please review the Places Rules and Policies, which are part of the User
            Agreement and outline what is prohibited on the Services. You may use the Services
            only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
            Our Services evolve constantly. As such, the Services may change from time to time,
            at our discretion. We may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services
            or any features within the Services to you or to users generally. We also retain the
            right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time. We may
            also remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, limit distribution or
            visibility of any Content on the service, suspend or terminate users, and reclaim
            usernames without liability to you.
            In consideration for Places granting you access to and use of the Services, you
            agree that Places and its third-party providers and partners may place advertising
            on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from
            the Services whether submitted by you or others. You also agree not to misuse our
            Services, for example, by interfering with them or accessing them using a method
            other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You agree that you will
            not work around any technical limitations in the software provided to you as part of
            the Services, or reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except
            and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits. You may not do any
            of the following while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use
            non-public areas of the Services, Places’s computer systems, or the technical
            delivery systems of Places’s providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of
            any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication
            measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any
            means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available,
            published interfaces that are provided by Places (and only pursuant to the
            applicable terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so
            in a separate agreement with Places (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if
            done in accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the
            Services without the prior consent of Places is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any
            TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting,
            or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying
            information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any
            user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading,
            flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of 
            Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the
            Services. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any
            information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law,
            regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including
            investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address
            fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or
            (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Places, its users and the public.
            Places does not disclose personally-identifying information to third parties
            except in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
            Places may offer certain services or features for which additional terms and
            conditions may apply in connection with your use of those services. By using
            or paying for any of these additional services, you agree to any additional terms
            applicable to those services, and those additional terms become part of our
            agreement with you. If any of the applicable additional terms conflict with these
            Terms, the additional terms will prevail while you are using those services to which
            they apply.
            If you use paid features of the Services, you agree to the applicable Terms for Paid
            Services <link>.
            If you use developer features of the Services, including but not limited to
            Places for Websites <link>,
            Places Cards <link>, Public API <link>, or Sign
            in with Places <link>, you agree to our Developer Agreement <link> and Developer Policy <link>. 
            If you want to reproduce, modify, create derivative
            works, distribute, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or
            otherwise use the Services or Content on the Services, you must use the interfaces
            and instructions we provide, except as permitted through the Places Services,
            these Terms, or the terms provided on <link>. 
            If you are a security researcher, you are required to comply with
            the rules of the Places Vulnerability Reporting Program <link>.
            The requirements set out in the preceding paragraph may not apply to those
            participating in Places’s Vulnerability Reporting Program.
            If you use advertising features of the Services, you must agree to our Places Master
            Services Agreement (https://ads.Places.com/terms).

            Your Account
            You may need to create an account to use some of our Services. You are responsible
            for safeguarding your account, so use a strong password and limit its use to this
            account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your
            failure to comply with the above.
            You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to
            provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and
            administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the
            Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them.
            If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate
            that phone number, you must update your account information to help prevent us
            from communicating with anyone who acquires your old number.
            Your License to Use the Services
            Places gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and nonexclusive license to use the 
            software provided to you as part of the Services.
            This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit
            of the Services as provided by Places, in the manner permitted by these Terms.
            The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the
            United States and other countries. Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use
            the Places name or any of the Places trademarks, logos, domain names, other
            distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights. All right, title, and interest
            in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain
            the exclusive property of Places and its licensors. Any feedback, comments, or
            suggestions you may provide regarding Places, or the Services is entirely voluntary
            and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit
            and without any obligation to you.

            Ending These Terms
            You may end your legal agreement with Places at any time by deactivating your
            accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services. See <link> for instructions on how to
            deactivate your account and the Privacy Policy for more information on what
            happens to your information.
            We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of
            the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we
            reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Places Rules and
            Policies or Periscope Community Guidelines, (ii) you create risk or possible legal
            exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct,
            (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision
            of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable
            efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next
            time you attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. In all
            such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to
            use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: 2, 3, 5,
            and 6. If you believe your account was terminated in error you can file an appeal
            following the steps found in our Help Center (https://help.Places.com/forms/
            general?subtopic=suspended). For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms survive
            the deactivation or termination of your account.
            5. Limitation of Liability
            By using the Services you agree that Places, its parents, affiliates, related
            companies, officers, directors, employees, agents representatives, partners and
            licensors, liability is limited to the maximum extent permissible in your country of
            residence.
            6. General
            We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive,
            and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be at Places.com/tos,
            will govern our relationship with you. Other than for changes addressing new
            functions or made for legal reasons, we will notify you 30 days in advance of making
            effective changes to these Terms that impact the rights or obligations of any party
            to these Terms, for example via a service notification or an email to the email
            associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after
            those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
            In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
            then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary,
            and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
            Places’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed
            a waiver of such right or provision.
            These Terms are an agreement between you and Places International Unlimited
            Company, an Irish company with its registered office at One Cumberland Place,
            Fenian Street Dublin 2, D02 AX07 Ireland. If you have any questions about these
            Terms, please contact us.

            Places Privacy Policy
            Before you scroll, read this
            It’s really hard to make everyone happy
            with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use
            Places want something short and easy to
            understand. While we wish we could fit
            everything you need to know into a post,
            our regulators ask us to meet our legal
            obligations by describing them all in a lot
            of detail.
            With that in mind, we’ve written our
            Privacy Policy as simply as possible to
            empower you to make informed decisions
            when you use Places by making sure you
            understand and have control over the
            information we collect, how it’s used, and
            when it’s shared. 
            So if you skip reading every word of the
            Privacy Policy, at least know this:
            Places is a public platform
            Learn what’s viewable & searchable
            We collect some data about you

            how we use data, just ask

            Seriously — what happens
            with my data?
            1. Information We Collect
            The information we collect when you use Places falls into three categories.
            1.1 Information you provide us
            To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and
            to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise,
            if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you
            without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is
            necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.
            • Personal Accounts. If you create an account, you must provide us
            with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This
            includes a display name (for example, “Places Moments”); a username
            (for example, @PlacesMoments); a password; an email address or phone
            number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single
            sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also
            choose to share your location in your profile and Tweets, and to upload
            your address book to Places to help find people you may know. Your
            profile information, which includes your display name and username,
            is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym.
            And remember, you can create multiple Places accounts, for example,
            to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.
            What data do you collect about me?
            You give some data, we get some data. In return we offer useful
            services. Not what you had in mind? Check your settings.
            • Professional Accounts. If you create a professional account, you also need
            to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other
            information, including street address, contact email address, and contact
            phone number, all of which will always be public.
            • Payment Information. In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided
            as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment
            information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date,
            CVV code, and billing address.
            • Preferences. When you set your preferences using your settings, we collect
            that information so that we can respect your preferences.
            1.2 Information we collect when you
            use Places
            When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our
            products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and
            services, to help keep Places more secure and respectful for everyone, and more
            relevant to you.
            Usage Information. We collect information about your activity on Places,
            including:
            • Tweets and other content you post (including the date, application, and version
            of Places) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., PlacesLive or
            Spaces), including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them,
            your lists, bookmarks, and communities you are a part of.
            • Your interactions with other users’ content, such as Reposts, likes, shares,
            replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag
            them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in (including your viewing history,
            listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).
            • How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and
            people who follow you, and when you use Direct Messages, including the
            contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.
            • If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information
            about the communication and its content.
            • We collect information on links you interact with across our services (including
            in our emails sent to you).
            Purchase and payments. To allow you to make a payment or send money
            using Places features or services, including through an intermediary, we may
            receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when
            a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.
            Device Information. We collect information from and about the devices you use
            to access Places, including:
            • Information about your connection, such as your IP address and browser
            type.
            • Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising
            ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery
            level.
            • Your device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.
            Location Information. When you use Places, we collect some information about
            your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing
            you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or
            places where you’ve previously used Places by enabling these settings in your
            account.
            Inferred Identity. We may collect or receive information that we use to infer
            your identity as detailed below:
            • When you sign into Places on a browser or device, we will associate that
            browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also
            associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to
            sign into Places (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other
            browsers or devices or Places-generated identifiers).
            • When you provide other information to Places, including an email address
            or phone number, we associate that information with your Places account.
            Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer
            other information about your identity, for example by associating your
            account with hashes of email addresses that share common components
            with the email address you have provided to Places.
            • When you access Places and are not signed in, we may infer your identity
            based on the information we collect.
            Log Information. We may receive information when you view content on or
            otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created
            an account or are signed out, such as:
            • IP address; browser type and language; operating system; the referring
            webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device
            information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs
            (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on Places;
            Places-generated identifiers; and identifiers associated with cookies. We
            also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on
            our services, including when you install another application through Places.
            Advertisements. When you view or interact with ads we serve on or off Places,
            we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a
            video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with Reposts of or replies to
            an ad).
            Cookies and similar technologies. Like many websites, we use cookies and
            similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our
            services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services
            such as searching and looking at public profiles. You can learn more about how
            we use cookies and similar technologies here.
            Interactions with our content on third-party sites. When you view our content
            on third-party websites that integrate Places content such as embedded timelines
            or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you
            visited.
            1.3 Information we receive from third
            parties
            When you use other online products and services, they may share information
            about that usage with us.
            Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers. Our ad and business partners share
            information with us such as browser cookie IDs, Places-generated identifiers,
            mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic
            or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some
            of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar
            information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising
            technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected
            by Places from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be
            combined with the other information you share with Places and that Places
            receives, generates, or infers about you described elsewhere in this Privacy
            Policy.
            Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations. We may receive
            information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as
            other Places users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety
            and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other
            services you link to your Places account. You may choose to connect your
            Places account to your account on another service, and that other service may
            send us information about your account on that service.
            2. How we use information
            Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the
            way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of
            information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single
            service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information
            and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us.
            Here we go:
            2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize
            our service
            We use the information we collect to provide and operate Places products and
            services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our
            products and services so that you have a better experience on Places, including
            by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to
            follow, enabling and helping you discover affiliates, third-party apps, and services.
            We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that
            you choose to connect your Places account to provide you features like
            cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
            We use your contact information to help others find your account if your
            settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
            We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content
            services subject to your settings, which helps make ads on Places more
            relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness
            of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of
            Places. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information
            directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology.
            How do you use my information?
            To make Places the service you know and love.
            Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Places from
            the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the
            other information you share with Places and that Places receives, generates,
            or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
            2.2 Foster safety and security
            We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our
            users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your
            identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized
            use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect
            the safety and quality of content on Places - this includes investigating
            and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.
            2.3 Measure, analyze and make
            our services better.
            We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness
            of our products and services and to better understand how you use them
            in order to make them better.
            2.4 Communicate with you about
            our services.
            We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products
            and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies
            and terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing
            messages from time to time.
            2.5 Research.
            We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research,
            surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve
            our products and services.
            My Tweets are public?!?
            3. Sharing Information
            You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how
            you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.
            3.1 When you post, post, and share.
            With the general public. You are directing us to disclose that information
            as broadly as possible. Places content, including your profile information
            (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing
            by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view much
            of the content on Places. They may also find Places content off of Places,
            for example from search query results on Internet search engines.
            With other Places users. Depending on your settings, and based on the
            Places products and services you use, we share:
            • Your interactions with Places content of other users, such as likes,
            and people you follow.
            • Content you send to a specific Places user, such as through Direct Messages.
            Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages
            or protected Tweets with someone else who accesses Places through
            a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party
            service.
            How or when do you share my information?
            There’s no quick answer to this one, but heads up:
            Tweets can end up in the news or a search engine.
            With partners. Depending on your settings, we also provide certain third
            parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and
            services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center.
            You can control whether Places shares your personal information with these
            partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
            Privacy & Safety settings. (This setting does not control sharing described
            elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with
            our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this
            Help Center article.)
            3.2 With third parties & third-party
            integrations.
            With service providers. We may share your information with our service
            providers that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including
            payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host
            our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use
            of our services; and those that provide fraud detection services.
            With advertisers. Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and
            services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their
            ads on or off Places. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our
            services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came
            from Places, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked,
            such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other
            Places-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal
            information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
            Third-party content & integrations. We share or disclose your information
            with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a thirdparty web client or 
            application to access your account or when you direct us
            to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience,
            we work with third-party partners to display their video content on Places
            or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact
            with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may
            receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy
            policies. For video content, you can adjust your autoplay settings if you prefer
            that content not to play automatically.
            Through our APIs. We use technology like APIs and embeds to make public
            Places information available to websites, apps, and others for their use,
            for example, displaying Tweets on a news website or analyzing what people
            say on Places. We generally make this content available in limited quantities
            for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard
            terms that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program
            to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated
            with Places, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on Places.
            For more information about how we make public data on Places available
            to the world, visit https://developer.Places.com.
            3.3 When required by law, to prevent
            harm, or in the public interest.
            We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that
            it is reasonably necessary to:
            • comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request;
            • protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform,
            including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;
            • explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services
            (e.g., for a violation of Places Rules);
            • address fraud, security, or technical issues; or
            • protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use
            our services.
            3.4 With our Affiliates.
            We may share information amongst our affiliates to provide our products
            and services.
            3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.
            We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with
            a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy
            Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after
            the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.
            Does data have an expiration
            date?
            4. How Long We Keep
            Information
            We keep different types of information for different periods of time:
            • We keep your profile information and content for the duration of your
            account.
            • We generally keep other personally identifiable data we collect when you
            use our products and services for a maximum of 18 months.
            • Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after you remove
            it from Places. For example, search engines and other third parties may
            retain copies of your Tweets longer, based upon their own privacy policies,
            even after they are deleted or expire on Places. You can read more about
            search visibility here.
            • Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the
            identifiers you used to create the account (i.e., email address or phone number)
            indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.
            • We may keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order
            to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons.
            How long do you keep data?
            Generally, we keep your data as long as your account is up.
            5. Take Control
            5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.
            You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing
            your profile and adjusting your account settings.
            • You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about
            you in Your Places Data and request access to additional information here.
            • You can download a copy of your information, such as your Tweets,
            by following the instructions here.
            • On the Periscope website, you can request correction or modification
            of your information, and download your account information, by following
            the instructions here.
            To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity
            before granting you access to your personal information or complying with
            a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations,
            reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may
            reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.
            How can I control my data?
            You can access it, delete it, or change your settings.
            Basically, you’re the boss.
            5.2 Deleting your Information.
            If you follow the instructions here (or for Periscope here), your account will be
            deactivated. When deactivated, your Places account, including your display name,
            username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on Places.com, Places for
            iOS, and Places for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible
            to restore your Places account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
            5.3 Objecting to, Restricting,
            or Withdrawing your Consent.
            You can manage your privacy settings and other account features here.
            If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully
            reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your Places
            experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending
            on the settings you’ve adjusted.
            Places adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for
            Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred to as “interest-based advertising”)
            and respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interestbased advertising at 
            <link>

            5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.
            To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your
            information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized
            agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact Places
            section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional
            information for verification.

            6. Your Rights and Ours
            We provide Places to people all over the world and provide many of the same
            privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However,
            your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure
            Places respects local requirements.

            6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your
            information.
            Places has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect,
            use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn
            more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
            this additional information about data processing. And no, we don’t sell your
            personal information.

            6.2 We move your data to make Places
            work for you.
            Just as you use Places to seamlessly participate in global conversations with
            people in countries all over the world, Places must move information across
            borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and
            reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having
            a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move
            between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect
            from us.
            How does Places handle my information wherever I am?
            We treat your information fairly, no matter where you live
            around the world.
            We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage our affiliates and
            third-party partners and service providers located in many parts of the world to
            help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look
            at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on things like standard
            contractual clauses, where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected.
            If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same
            protections over your data that we provide directly.

            7. Places’s Audience
            Our services are not directed to children, and you may not use our services if you
            are under the age of 13. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing
            of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent
            or guardian to do so on your behalf).
            Is Places for kids?
            Nope, Places is not intended for people under 13.
            You there, Places?

            8. Changes To This
            Privacy Policy
            The most current version of this Privacy Policy governs our processing of your
            personal data and we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as needed.
            If we do revise this Privacy Policy and make changes that are determined by us to
            be material, we will provide you notice and an opportunity to review the revised
            Privacy Policy before you continue to use Places.
            Will this policy change?
            If it does, we’ll let you know.

            9. How To Contact Places
            We want to hear from you if you have thoughts or questions about this
            Privacy Policy. You can contact us via our Privacy Policy Inquiries page

            responsible for your personal data is

            The Places Rules
            Places’s purpose is to serve the public
            conversation. Violence, harassment
            and other similar types of behavior
            discourage people from expressing
            themselves, and ultimately diminish
            the value of global public conversation.
            Our rules are to ensure all people can
            participate in the public conversation
            freely and safely.
