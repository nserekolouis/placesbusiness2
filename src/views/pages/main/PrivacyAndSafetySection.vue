              We believe you should always know what data we collect from you
              and how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control
              over both. We want to empower you to make the best decisions about
              the information that you share with us. That’s the basic purpose
              of this Privacy Policy.

              You should read this policy in full, but here are a few key things
              we hope you take away from it:
            </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Places is public and Posts are immediately viewable and
                  searchable by anyone around the world. We give you non-public
                  ways to communicate on Places too, through protected Posts and
                  Direct Messages. You can also use Places under a pseudonym if
                  you prefer not to use your name.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  When you use Places, even if you’re just looking at Posts, we
                  receive some personal information from you like the type of
                  device you’re using and your IP address. You can choose to
                  share additional information with us like your email address,
                  phone number, address book contacts, and a public profile. We
                  use this information for things like keeping your account
                  secure and showing you more relevant Posts, people to follow,
                  events, and ads.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  We give you control through your settings to limit the data we
                  collect from you and how we use it, and to control things like
                  account security, marketing preferences, apps that can access
                  your account, and address book contacts you’ve uploaded to
                  Places. You can also download information you have shared on
                  Places.

              <li>
                <p>
                  In addition to information you share with us, we use your
                  Posts, content you’ve read, Liked, or RePosted, and other
                  information to determine what topics you’re interested in,
                  your age, the languages you speak, and other signals to show
                  you more relevant content. We give you transparency into that
                  information, and you can modify or correct it at any time.

            <h3>Information You Share With Us</h3>
            <p>
              We require certain information to provide our services to you. For
              example, you must have an account in order to upload or share
              content on Places. When you choose to share the information below
              with us, we collect and use it to operate our services.
            </p>

                    <h4>Basic Account Information</h4>
                    <p>
                      You don’t have to create an account to use some of our
                      service features, such as searching and viewing public
                      Places profiles or watching a broadcast. If you do choose
                      to create an account, you must provide us with some
                      personal data so that we can provide our services to you.
                      On Places this includes a display name (for example,
                      “Places Moments”), a userhandle (for example, @Placesint),
                      a password, and an email address or phone number. Your
                      display name and username are always public, but you can
                      use either your real name or a pseudonym. If you choose to
                      create a professional account, you must also provide us
                      with your professional category, and may provide us with
                      additional information, including street address, contact
                      email address, and contact phone number, all of which will
                      always be public. You can also create and manage multiple
                      Places accounts, for example to express different parts of
                      your identity
                    </p>
                  </li>

                    <h4>Public Information</h4>
                    <p>
                      Most activity on Places is public, including your profile
                      information , your display language, when you created your
                      account, and your Posts and certain information about your
                      Posts like the date, time, and application and version of
                      Places you Posted from. You also may choose to publish
                      your location in your Posts or your Places profile. When
                      you share audio or visual content on our service we may
                      analyze that data to operate our services, for example by
                      providing audio transcription. The lists you create,
                      people you follow and who follow you, and Posts you Like
                      or Share are also public. If you like, Share, reply, or
                      otherwise publicly engage with an ad on our services, that
                      advertiser might thereby learn information about you
                      associated with the ad with which you engaged such as
                      characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to
                      reach. Broadcasts (including Places) you create are public
                      along with when you created them. Your engagement with
                      broadcasts, including viewing, listening, commenting,
                      speaking, reacting to, or otherwise participating in them,
                      on Places, is public along with when you took those
                      actions. So are your hearts, comments, the number of
                      hearts you’ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan
                      of, and whether you watched a broadcast live or on replay.
                      Any engagement with another account’s broadcast will
                      remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on
                      our services. Information posted about you by other people
                      who use our services may also be public. For example,
                      other people may tag you in a photo or video. (if your
                      settings allow) or mention you in a Post. You are
                      responsible for your Posts and other information you
                      provide through our services, and you should think
                      carefully about what you make public, especially if it is
                      sensitive information. If you update your public
                      information on Places, such as by deleting a Post or
                      deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated
                      content on thefavplaces.com, Places for iOS, and Places
                      for Android. By publicly posting content, you are
                      directing us to disclose that information as broadly as
                      possible, including through our APIs, and directing those
                      accessing the information through our APIs to do the same.
                      To facilitate the fast global dissemination of Posts to
                      people around the world, we use technology like
                      application programming interfaces (APIs) and embeds to
                      make that information available to websites, apps, and
                      others for their use - for example, displaying Posts on a
                      news website or analyzing what people say on Places. We
                      generally make this content available in limited
                      quantities for free and charge licensing fees for
                      large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how
                      this data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce
                      these terms. But these individuals and companies are not
                      affiliated with Places, and their offerings may not
                      reflect updates you make on Places. For more information
                      about how we make public data on Places available to the
                      world, visit https://developer.Places.com.

                    <h4>Contact Information and Address Books</h4>
                    <p>
                      We use your contact information, such as your email
                      address or phone number, to authenticate your account and
                      keep it - and our services - secure, and to help prevent
                      spam, fraud, and abuse. Subject to your settings, we also
                      use contact information to enable certain account features
                      (for example, for login verification), to send you
                      information about our services, and to personalize our
                      services, including ads. If you provide us with your phone
                      number, you agree to receive text messages from Places to
                      that number as your country’s laws allow. Places also uses
                      your contact information to market to you as your
                      country’s laws allow, and to help others find your account
                      if your settings permit, including through thirdparty
                      services and client applications. You can use your
                      settings for email and mobile notifications to control
                      notifications you receive from Places. You can also
                      unsubscribe from a notification by following the
                      instructions contained within the notification or here.
                      You can choose to upload and sync your address book on
                      Places so that we can help you find and connect with
                      people you know and help others find and connect with you.
                      We also use this information to better recommend content
                      to you and others.

                    <h4>Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications</h4>
                    <p>
                      We provide certain features that let you communicate more
                      privately or control who sees your content. For example,
                      you can use Direct Messages to have non-public
                      conversations on Places, protect your Posts, or host
                      private broadcasts on Our other products. When you
                      communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct
                      Messages, we will store and process your communications
                      and information related to them. This includes link
                      scanning for malicious content, link shortening to
                      http://t.co URLs, detection of spam4 , abuse and
                      prohibited images, and use of reported issues. We also use
                      information about whom you have communicated with and when
                      (but not the content of those communications) to better
                      understand the use of our services, to protect the safety
                      and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant
                      content. We share the content of your Direct Messages with
                      the people you’ve sent them to; we do not use them to
                      serve you ads. Note that if you interact in a way that
                      would ordinarily be public with Places content shared with
                      you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Post,
                      those interactions will be public. When you use features
                      like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that
                      recipients have their own copy of your communications on
                      Places - even if you delete your copy of those messages
                      from your account - which they may duplicate, store, or
                      re-share.

                      features or services, including through an intermediary,
                      we may receive information about your transaction such as

                          and personalization. Subject to your settings, we may
                          also associate your account with browsers or devices
                          other than those you use to log into Places (or
                          associate your logged-out device or browser with other
                          browsers or devices). When you provide other
                          information to Places, including an email address, we
                          associate that information with your Places account.
                          Subject to your settings, we may also use this
                          information in order to infer other information about
                          your identity, for example by associating your account
                          with hashes of email addresses that share common
                          components with the email address you have provided to
                          Places. We do this to operate and personalize our
                          services. For example, if you visit websites with
                          sports content on your laptop, we may show you
                          sports-related ads on Places for Android and, if the
                          email address associated with your account shares
                          components with another email address, such as shared
                          first name, last name, or initials, we may later match
                          advertisements to you from advertisers that were
                          trying to reach email addresses containing those
                          components.

                <p>
                  As noted above, Places is designed to broadly and instantly
                  disseminate information you share publicly through our
                  services. In the limited circumstances where we disclose your
                  private personal data, we do so subject to your control,
                  because it’s important for operating our services, or because
                  it’s required by law.

                    <h3>Sharing You Control</h3>
                    <p>
                      We share or disclose your personal data with your consent
                      or at your direction, such as when you authorize a
                      third-party web client or application to access your
                      account or when you direct us to share your feedback with
                      a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work
                      with third-party partners to display their video content
                      on Places. When you watch or otherwise interact with
                      content from these partners, they may receive and process
                      your personal data as described in their privacy policies.
                      If you do not want this content to play automatically, you
                      can adjust your autoplay settings. If you’ve shared
                      information like Direct Messages or protected Posts with
                      someone else who accesses Places through a third-party
                      service, keep in mind that the information may be shared
                      with the third-party service. Subject to your settings, we
                      also provide certain third parties with personal data to
                      help us offer or operate our services. You can learn more
                      about these partnerships in our Help Center, and you can
                      control whether Places shares your personal data in this
                      way by using the “Allow additional information sharing
                      with business partners” option in your Personalization and
                      Data settings. (This setting does not control sharing
                      described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy, such as when we
                      share data with our service providers or through

                      We engage service providers to perform functions and
                      provide services for us in the United States, Ireland, and
                      other countries. For example, we use a variety of
                      third-party services to help operate our services, such as
                      hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us
                      understand the use of our services, such as Google
                      Analytics. We may share your private personal data with
                      such service providers subject to obligations consistent
                      with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
                      confidentiality and security measures, and on the
                      condition that the third parties use your private personal
                      data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions
                      (service providers may use other non-personal data for
                      their own benefit). We share your payment information with
                      payment services providers to process payments; prevent,
                      detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited
                      activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as
                      chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated
                      with the acceptance of credit and debit cards

                      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy
                      Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may
                      preserve, use, share, or disclose your personal data or
                      other safety data if we believe that it is reasonably
                      necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process,
                      or governmental request; to protect the safety of any
                      person; to protect the safety or integrity of our
                      platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or
                      malicious actors on our services, or to explain why we
                      have removed content or accounts from our services8 ; to
                      address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to
                      protect our rights or property or the rights or property
                      of those who use our services. However, nothing in this
                      Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or
                      objections that you may have to a third party’s, including

                      acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your
                      personal data may be sold or transferred as part of that
                      transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your
                      personal data as transferred to the new entity. We may
                      also disclose personal data about you to our corporate
                      affiliates in order to help operate our services and our

                      with a Post, demographics, the number of people who

                <h4>Our Global Operations and Data Transfers</h4>
                <p>
                  To bring you our services, we operate globally. Where the laws
                  of your country allow you to do so, you authorize us to
                  transfer, store, and use your data in the United States,
                  Ireland, and any other country where we operate. In some of
                  the countries to which we transfer personal data, the privacy
                  and data protection laws and rules regarding when government
                  authorities may access data may vary from those of your
                  country. Places does not sell your personal data as defined
                  under the California Consumer Privacy Act. Learn more about
                  our global operations and data transfer here. When we transfer
                  personal data outside of the European Union, EFTA States,
                  Brazil or the United Kingdom we ensure an adequate level of
                  protection for the rights of data subjects based on the
                  adequacy of the receiving country’s data protection laws
                  and/or contractual obligations placed on the recipient of the
                  data (where we rely on the EU standard contractual clauses
                  these may be requested by inquiry as described below). Places,
                  Inc. complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
                  principles (the “Principles”) regarding the collection, use,
                  sharing, and retention of personal data from the European
                  Union, EFTA States, and the United Kingdom as described in our
                  EU-US Privacy Shield certification and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
                  certification. We do not rely on the EU-US or Swiss-US Privacy
                  Shield as our lawful basis to transfer personal data from the
                  European Union, EFTA States, or the United Kingdom, however.
                  If you have a Privacy Shield-related complaint, please contact
                  us here. As part of our participation in Privacy Shield, if
                  you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the
                  Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal
                  complaint resolution process, alternatively through the
                  independent dispute resolution body JAMS, and under certain
                  conditions, through the Privacy Shield arbitration process.
                  Privacy Shield participants are subject to the investigatory
                  and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and
                  other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain
                  circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of
                  personal data from the EU, EFTA States, or the United Kingdom
                  to third parties outside the EU, EFTA States, and the United
                  Kingdom. Learn more about the EU-US Privacy Shield and
